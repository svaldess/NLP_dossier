# Automatic Terminology Analysis for Data Science Job Descriptions

Project elaborated with _Anwesha Tomar_ and _Marta Matosas Fonolleda_. Special thanks to _Avijeet Kartikay_ for offering orientation with web scraping. This project involves:

1) Web scraping of Indeed web page. 
2) Extraction of most frequent terminology (unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams) in data science job desriptions. 
3) Comparison between data science terminology and software engineering terminology. 
4) Measure the Tf-idf scores of data science terminology to obtain the most relevant terms.
5) Analysis of data science terminology found in 6 different U.S. cities (D.C., New York, Chicago, Austin, Los Angeles, San Francsico) and 7 different industries (Healthcare, Banks and financial services, Insurance, Government, Aeropsace and Defense, Technology, Consulting and Business Services).

_**Top findings**_:

1) Data Science and Software Engineering job descriptions share common terminology.
2) Data Science terminology is mostly composed of unigrams and bigrams. 
3) Python, R, Communication skill, Best practice are the most relevant terms in Data Science.
4) A Chi-squared of independence test concluded that Data Science terminology is dependent upon cities and industries.
