The Fundamental Principle of a Republic\
21 June 1915\
When I came into your hall tonight, I thought of the last time I was in your\'a0city. Twenty\'adone years ago I came here with Susan B. Anthony, and we came for\'a0exactly\'a0the same purpose as that for which we are here tonight. Boys have been born since that time and have become voters, and the women are still trying to persuade American men to believe in the fundamental principles of democracy, and I never\'a0quite feel as if it was a fair\'a0field to argue this question with men, because in doing it you have to assume that a man who professes to believe in a Republican form of government does not believe in a Republican form\'a0of government, for the only\'a0thing that woman's enfranchisement means at all is that a government which claims to be a Republic should be a Republic, and not an aristocracy. The difficulty with discussing this\'a0question with those who oppose us is that they\'a0make any\'a0number\'a0of arguments but none of them have anything to do with Woman's Suffrage\uc0\u894  they\'a0always have something to do with something else, therefore the arguments which we have to make rarely\'a0ever\'a0have anything to do with the subject, because we have to answer\'a0our\'a0opponents\'a0who always escape the subject as far as possible in order\'a0to have any\'a0sort of reason in connection with what they say. Now one of two things is true: either\'a0a Republic is a desirable form\'a0of government, or else it is not. If it is, then we should have it, if it is not then we ought not to pretend that we have it. We ought at least be true to our\'a0ideals, and the men of New York\'a0have for\'a0the first time in their\'a0lives, the rare opportunity on the second day\'a0of next November, of making the state truly\'a0a part of the Republic. It is the greatest opportunity\'a0which has ever come to the men of the state. They\'a0have never\'a0had so serious a problem to solve before, they\'a0will never\'a0have a more serious problem to solve in any\'a0future of our\'a0nation's life, and the thing that disturbs me more than anything else in connection with it is that so few people realize what a profound problem\'a0they\'a0 have to solve on November\'a02.  It is not merely a trifling matter\u894  it is not a little thing that does not concern the state, it is the most vital problem\'a0we could have, and any man who goes to the polls on the second day\'a0of next November\'a0without thoroughly\'a0informing himself in regard to this subject is unworthy\'a0to be a citizen of this state, and unfit to cast a ballot. If woman's suffrage is wrong, it is a great wrong\u894  if it is right, it is a profound and fundamental principle, and we all know, if we know what a Republic\'a0is, that it is the fundamental principle upon which a Republic\'a0must rise. Let us see where we are as a people\u894  how we act here and what we think\'a0we are. The difficulty\'a0with the men of this country\'a0is that they\'a0are so consistent in their\'a0inconsistency\'a0that they are not aware of having been inconsistent\u894  because their\'a0consistency\'a0has been so continuous and their\'a0inconsistency\'a0so consecutive that it has never\'a0been broken, from\'a0the beginning of our\'a0Nation's life to the present time. If we trace our\'a0history\'a0back we will find that from\'a0the very\'a0dawn of our\'a0existence as a people, men have been imbued with a spirit and a vision more lofty\'a0than they\'a0have been able to live\u894  they\'a0have been led by\'a0 visions of the sublimest truth, both in regard to religion and in regard to government that ever\'a0inspired the souls of men from\'a0the time the Puritans left the old world to come to this country, led by\'a0the Divine ideal which is the sublimest and the supremest ideal in religious freedom\'a0which men have ever known, the theory\'a0 that a man has a right to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, without the intervention of any\'a0other\'a0man or\'a0any\'a0other\'a0group of men. And it was this theory, this vision of the right of the human soul which led men first to the shores of this country. Now, nobody\'a0can deny\'a0that they\'a0are sincere, honest, and earnest men. No one can deny\'a0that the Puritans\'a0 were men of profound conviction, and yet these men who gave up everything in behalf of an ideal, hardly\'a0 established their\'a0communities in this new country\'a0before they\'a0began to practice exactly the same sort of persecutions on other\'a0men which had been practiced upon them. They\'a0settled in their\'a0communities on the New England shores and when they\'a0formed their compacts by\'a0which they\'a0governed their\'a0local societies, they\'a0permitted no man to have a voice in the affairs unless he was a member\'a0of the church, and not a member of any church, but a member of the particular\'a0church which dominated the particular community in which he happened to be. In Massachusetts, they\'a0drove the Baptists down to Rhode Island\u894  in Connecticut they\'a0drove the Presbyterians over\'a0to New Jersey\u894  they\'a0burned the Quakers in Massachusetts and ducked the witches, and no colony, either\'a0Catholic or\'a0Protestant allowed a Jew to have a voice. And so a man must worship God according to the conscience of the particular\'a0community\'a0in which he was located, and yet they\'a0called that religious freedom, they\'a0were not able to live the ideal of religious liberty, and from that time to this the men of this government have been following along the same line of inconsistency, while they too have been following a vision of equal grandeur\'a0and power. Never\'a0in the history of the world did it dawn upon the human mind as it dawned upon your\'a0ancestors, what it would mean for men to be free. They got the vision of a government in which the people would be the supreme power, and so inspired by\'a0this vision men wrote such documents as were went from\'a0the Massachusetts legislature, from\'a0the New York\'a0legislature and from the Pennsylvania group over to the Parliament of Great Britain, which rang with the profoundest measures of freedom and justice. They\'a0did not equivocate in a single word when they\'a0wrote the Declaration of Independence\u894  no one can dream that these men had not got the sublimest ideal of democracy\'a0which had ever\'a0dawned upon the souls of men. But as soon as the war\'a0was over\'a0and our\'a0government was formed, instead of asking the question, who shall be the governing force in this great new Republic, when they\'a0brought those thirteen little territories together, they\'a0began to eliminate instead of include the men who should be the great governing forces, and they said, who shall have the voice in this great new Republic, and you would have supposed that such men as fought the Revolutionary\'a0War\'a0would have been able to answer that every man who has fought, everyone who has\'a0 given up all he has and all he has been able to accumulate shall be free, it never\'a0entered their\'a0minds. These excellent ancestors of yours had not been away\'a0from the old world long enough to realize that man is\'a0 of more value than his purse, so they\'a0said every man who has an estate in the government shall have a voice\u894  and they\'a0said what shall that estate be? And they\'a0answered that a man who had property\'a0valued at two hundred and fifty dollars will be able to cast a vote, and so they\'a0sang "The land of the free and the home of the brave."\'a0And they\'a0wrote into their\'a0Constitution, "All males who pay\'a0taxes on $250 shall cast a vote,"\'a0 and they\'a0called themselves a Republic, and we call ourselves a Republic, and they\'a0were not quite so much of a Republic\'a0that we should be called a Republic\'a0yet. We might call ourselves angels, but that wouldn't make us angels, you have got to be an angel before you are an angel, and you have got to be a Republic\'a0 before you are a Republic. Now what did we do? Before the word "male"\'a0in the local compacts, they\'a0wrote the word "Church\'admembers"\u894  and they wrote in the word "taxpayer."\'a0 Then there arose a great Democrat, Thomas Jefferson, who looked down into the day\'a0when you and I are living and saw that the rapidly accumulated wealth in the hands of a few men would endanger\'a0the liberties of the people, and he knew what you and I know, that no power\'a0under\'a0heaven or\'a0among men is known in a Republic\'a0by which men can defend their liberties except by\'a0the power\'a0of the ballot, and so the Democratic\'a0 party\'a0took\'a0another step in the evolution of the Republic\'a0out of a monarchy\'a0and they rubbed out the word "taxpayer"\'a0and wrote in the word "white", and then the Democrats thought the millennium had come, and they\'a0sang "\'a0The land of the free and the home of the brave"\'a0as lustily\'a0as the Republicans had sung it before them\'a0and spoke of the divine right of motherhood with the same thrill in their\'a0voices and at the same time they\'a0were selling mother's babies by\'a0the pound on the auction block\'adand mothers apart from their babies. Another\'a0arose who said a man is not a good citizen because he is white, he is a good citizen because he is\'a0 a man, and the Republican party\'a0took\'a0out that progressive evolutionary\'a0eraser\'a0and rubbed out the word "white"\'a0from\'a0before the word "male'\'a0and could not think of another\'a0word to put in there\'ad\'a0they\'a0were all in, black\'a0and white, rich and poor, wise and otherwise, drunk\'a0and sober\u894  not a man left out to be put in, and so the Republicans could not write anything before the word "male", and they\'a0had to let the little word, "male"\'a0 stay\'a0alone by\'a0itself. And God said in the beginning, "It is not good for man to stand alone."\'a0That is why\'a0we are here tonight, and that is all that woman's suffrage means\u894  just to repeat again and again that first declaration of the Divine, "It is not good for\'a0man to stand alone,"\'a0and so the women of this state are asking that the word "male" shall be stricken out of the Constitution altogether\'a0and that the Constitution stand as it ought to have stood in the beginning and as it must before this state is any\'a0part of a Republic. Every\'a0citizen possessing the necessary\'a0 qualifications shall be entitled to cast one vote at every\'a0election, and have that vote counted. We are not asking as our\'a0Anti\'adSuffrage friends think we are, for\'a0any\'a0of awful things that we hear\'a0will happen if we are allowed to vote\u894  we are simply asking that that government which professes to be a Republic shall be a Republic\'a0and not pretend to be what it is not. Now what is a Republic? Take your\'a0dictionary, encyclopedia lexicon or anything else you like and look up the definition and you will find that a Republic is a form of government in which the laws are enacted by\'a0 representatives elected by\'a0the people. Now when did the people of New York\'a0ever\'a0elect their\'a0own representatives? Never in the world. The men of New York\'a0have, and I grant you that men are people, admirable people, as far\'a0as they go, but they\'a0only\'a0go half way. There is still another half of the people who have not elected representatives, and you never\'a0read a definition of a Republic\'a0in which half of the people elect representatives to govern the whole of the people. That is an aristocracy\'a0and that is just what we are. We have been many\'a0kinds of aristocracies. We have been a hierarchy\'a0of church members, than an oligarchy of sex. There are two old theories, which are dying today. Dying hard, but dying. One of them\'a0is dying on the plains\'a0 of Flanders and the Mountains of Galicia and Austria, and that is the theory of the divine right of kings. The other\'a0is dying here in the state of New York\'a0and Massachusetts and New Jersey\'a0and Pennsylvania and that is the divine right of sex. Neither of them had a foundation in reason, or\'a0justice, or\'a0common sense. Now I want to make this proposition, and I believe every\'a0man will accept it. Of course he will if he is\'a0 intelligent. Whenever\'a0a Republic\'a0prescribes the qualifications as applying equally\'a0to all the citizens of the Republic, when the Republic\'a0says in order\'a0to vote, a citizen must be twenty\'adone years of age, it applies to all alike, there is no discrimination against any\'a0race or\'a0sex. When the government says that a citizen must be a native\'adborn citizen or a naturalized citizen that applies to all\u894  we are either\'a0born or\'a0naturalized, somehow or\'a0 other\'a0we are here. Whenever the government says that a citizen, in order to vote, must be a resident of a community\'a0a certain length of time, and of the state a certain length of time and of the nation a certain length of time, that applies to all equally. There is no discrimination. We might go further and we might say\'a0that in order\'a0to vote the citizen must be able to read his ballot. We have not gone that far\'a0yet. We have been very careful of male ignorance in these United States. I was much interested, as perhaps many\'a0of you, in reading the Congressional Record this last winter\'a0over\'a0 the debate over the immigration bill, and when that illiteracy\'a0clause was introduced into the immigration bill, what fear\'a0there was in the souls of men for\'a0fear\'a0we would do injustice to some of the people who might want to come to our\'a0shores, and I was much and I was much interested in the language in which the President vetoed the bill, when he declared that by inserting the clause we would keep out of our\'a0shores a large body\'a0 of very\'a0excellent people. I could not help wondering then how it happens that male ignorance is so much less ignorant than female ignorance. When I hear\'a0people say\'a0that if women were permitted to vote a large body\'a0of ignorant people would vote, and therefore because an ignorant woman would vote, no intelligent women should be allowed to vote, I wonder\'a0why\'a0we have made it so easy\'a0for\'a0male ignorance and so hard for female ignorance. When I was a girl, years ago, I lived in the back\'a0woods and there the number\'a0of votes cast at each election depended entirely\'a0upon the size of the ballot box. We had what was known as the old\'ad\'a0tissue ballots and the man who got the most tissue in was the man elected. Now the best part of our\'a0community was very\'a0much disturbed by\'a0this method, and they did not know what to do in order to get a ballot both safe and secret\u894  but they\'a0heard that over in Australia, where the women voted, they\'a0had a ballot which was both safe and secret, so we went over\'a0there and we got the Australian ballot and we brought it here. But when we got it over\'a0we found it was not adapted to this country, because in Australia they\'a0have to be able to read their ballot. Now the question was how could we adapt it to our\'a0conditions? Someone discovered that if you should put a symbol at the head of each column, like a rooster, or\'a0an eagle, or\'a0a hand holding a hammer, that if a man has intelligence to know the difference between a rooster\'a0and an eagle he will know which political party\'a0to vote for, and when the ballot was adapted it was a very beautiful ballot, it looked like a page from\'a0Life. Now almost any\'a0American could vote that ballot, or if she had not that intelligence to know the difference between an eagle and a rooster, we could take the eagle out and put in the hen. Now when we take so much pains to adapt the ballot to the male intelligence of the United States, we should be very humble when we talk\'a0about female ignorance. Now if we should take a vote and the men had to read their ballot in order\'a0 to vote it, more women could vote than men. But when the government says not only\'a0that you must be twenty\'adone years of age, a resident of the community and native born or naturalized, those are qualifications, but when it says that an elector\'a0must be a male, that is not a qualification for\'a0citizenship\u894  that is an insurmountable barrier\'a0between one half of the people and the other half of the citizens and their rights\'a0 as citizens. No such nation can call itself a Republic. It is only\'a0an aristocracy. That barrier\'a0must be removed before the government can become a Republic, and that is exactly what we are asking right now, that the last step in the evolutionary process be taken on November 2d. and that this great state of New York\'a0shall become in fact as it is in theory, a part of a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. Men know the inconsistencies themselves\u894  they\'a0realize it in one way\'a0while they\'a0do not realize it in another, because you never\'a0heard a man make a political speech when he did not speak\'a0of this country as a whole as though the thing existed which does not exist and that is that the people were equally\'a0free, because you hear\'a0them\'a0declare over\'a0and over\'a0again on the Fourth of July "under\'a0God the people rule."\'a0They\'a0know it is\'a0 not true, but they\'a0say\'a0it with a great hurrah, and they\'a0repeat over and over\'a0again that clause from\'a0the Declaration of Independence. "Governments derive their\'a0just powers from the consent of the governed," and they\'a0see how they\'a0can prevent half of us from\'a0giving our\'a0consent to anything, and then they\'a0give it to us on the Fourth of July in two languages, so if it is not true in one it will be in the other, "vox\'a0populi, vox\'a0Dei." "The voice of the people is the voice of God," and the orator forgets that in the people's voice there is a soprano as well as a bass. If the voice of the people is the voice of God, how are we ever going to know what God's voice is when we are content to listen to a bass solo? Now if it is true that the voice of the people is the voice of God, we will never\'a0know what the Deity's voice in government is until the bass and soprano are mingled together, the result of which will be the divine harmony. Take any of the magnificent appeals for freedom, which men make, and rob them\'a0of their\'a0universal application and you take the very\'a0life and soul out of them. Where is the difficulty? Just in one thing and one thing only, that men are so sentimental. We used to believe that women were the sentimental sex, but they can not hold a tallow candle compared with the arc\'a0 light of the men. Men are so sentimental in their attitude about women that they\'a0cannot reason about them. Now men are usually\'a0very\'a0fair to each other. I think the average man recognizes that he has no more right to anything at the hands of the government than has every\'a0other\'a0man. He has no right at all to anything to which every\'a0other\'a0man has not an equal right with himself. He says why\'a0have I a right to certain things in the government\u894  why\'a0have I a right to life and liberty\u894  why\'a0have I a right to this or\'a0this? Does he say\'a0because I am\'a0a man? Not at all, because I am\'a0human, and being human I have a right to everything which belongs to humanity, and every\'a0right which any\'a0other\'a0human being has, I have. And then he says of his neighbor, and my\'a0 neighbor\'a0he also is human, therefore every\'a0right which belongs to me as a human being, belongs to him\'a0as\'a0 a human being, and I have no right to anything under\'a0the government to which he is not equally\'a0entitled. And then up comes a woman, and then they\'a0say\'a0now she's a woman\u894  she is not quite human, but she is my\'a0 wife, or\'a0my\'a0sister, or my daughter, or\'a0an aunt, or my cousin. She is not quite human\u894  she is only related to a human, and being related to a human a human will take care of her. So we have had that care\'adtaking human being to look\'a0after\'a0us and they\'a0have not recognized that women too are equally\'a0human with men. Now if men could forget for a minute and believe the anti\'adsuffragists say\'a0that we want men to forget that we are related to them, they\'a0don't know men, if for a minute they\'a0could forget our\'a0relationship and remember\'a0 that we are equally human with themselves, then they\'a0would say, yes, and this human being, not because she is a woman, but because she is human is entitled to every privilege and every right under\'a0the government which I, as a human being am entitled to. The only reason men do not see as fairly in regard to women as they\'a0do in regard to each other is because they\'a0have looked upon us from\'a0an altogether\'a0different plane than what they\'a0have looked at men\u894  that is\'a0 because women have been the homemakers while men have been the so\'ad\'a0called protectors, in the period of the world's civilization when people needed to be protected. I know that they say\'a0that men protect us now and when we ask\'a0them what they\'a0are protecting us from\'a0the only\'a0answer\'a0they\'a0can give is from\'a0themselves. I do not think\'a0that men need any\'a0very\'a0great credit for protecting us from themselves. They\'a0are not protecting us from\'a0any\'a0special thing from\'a0which we could not protect ourselves except themselves. Now this old time idea of protection was all right when the world needed this protection, but today\'a0the protection in civilization comes from\'a0within and not from without. What are the arguments, which our\'a0good Anti\'adfriends give us? We know that lately they have stopped to argue and call suffragists all sorts of creatures. If there is anything we believe that we do not believe, we have not heard about them, so the cry goes out of this\u894  the cry\'a0of the infant's mind\u894  the cry\'a0of a little child. The anti\'adsuffragists'\'a0cries are all the cries of little children who are afraid of the unborn and are forever\'a0 crying, "The goblins will catch you if you don't watch out."\'a0So that anything that has not been should not be and all that is right, when as a matter of fact if the world believed that we would be in a static condition and never\'a0move, except back\'a0like a crab. And so the cry\'a0goes on. When suffragists are feminists, and when I ask\'a0what that is no one is able to tell me. I would give anything to know what a feminist is. They\'a0say, would you like to be a feminist? If I could find out I would, you either\'a0have to be masculine or\'a0feminine and I prefer\'a0feminine. Then they\'a0cry\'a0that we are socialists, and anarchists. Just how a human can be both at the same time, I really do not know. If I know what socialism means it means\'a0 absolute government and anarchism\'a0means no government at all. So we are feminists, socialists, anarchists, and Mormons or\'a0spinsters. Now that is about the list. I have not heard the last speech. Now as a matter\'a0of fact, as a unit we are nothing, as individuals we are like all other individuals. We have our\'a0theories, our\'a0beliefs, but as suffragists we have but one belief, but one principle, but one theory\'a0and that is the right of a human being to have a voice in the government, under\'a0which he or\'a0she lives, on that we agree, if on nothing else. Whether\'a0we agree or\'a0not on religion or\'a0politics we are concerned. A\'a0 clergyman asked me the other\'a0day, "\'a0By\'a0the way, what church does your\'a0official board belong to?"\'a0I said I don't know. He said, "\'a0Don't you know what religion your\'a0official board believes?" I said, "Really\'a0it never\'a0occurred to me, but I will [missing text] them\'a0up and see, they\'a0are not elected to my\'a0 board because they\'a0believe in any\'a0particular\'a0church. We had no concern either as to what we believe as\'a0 religionists or\'a0as to what we believe as women in regard to theories of government, except that one fundamental theory\'a0in the right of democracy. We do not believe in this fad or the other, but whenever\'a0any\'a0 question is to be settled in any\'a0community, then the people of that community\'a0shall settle that question, the women people equally with the men people. That is all there is to it, and yet when it comes to arguing our\'a0 case they\'a0bring up all sorts of arguments, and the beauty\'a0of it is they\'a0always answer\'a0all their own arguments. They\'a0never\'a0make an argument, but they answer\'a0it. When I was asked to answer\'a0one of their\'a0 debates I said, "\'a0What is the use? Divide up their\'a0literature and let them destroy\'a0themselves."\'a0 I was followed up last year\'a0by\'a0a young, married woman from\'a0New Jersey. She left her\'a0husband home for\'a0 three months to tell the women that their\'a0place was at home, and that they\'a0could not leave home long enough to go to the ballot box, and she brought all her\'a0arguments out in pairs and backed them up by\'a0 statistics. The anti\'adsuffragists can gather\'a0more statistics than any\'a0other\'a0person I ever saw, and there is\'a0 nothing so sweet and calm as when they\'a0say, "You cannot deny\'a0this, because here are the figures, and figures never lie."\'a0Well they\'a0don't but some liars figure. When they\'a0start out they\'a0always begin the same. She started by\'a0proving that it was no use to give the women the ballot because if they did have it they\'a0would not use it, and she had statistics to prove it. If we would not use it then I really\'a0can not see the harm of giving it to us, we would not hurt anybody\'a0with it and what an easy\'a0way\'a0for\'a0you men to get rid of us. No more suffrage meetings, never\'a0any nagging you again, no one could blame you for anything that went wrong with the town, if it did not run right, all you would have to say\'a0is, you have the power, why\'a0don't you go ahead and clean up. Then the young lady, unfortunately for her\'a0first argument, proved by statistics, of which she had many, the awful results which happened where women did have the ballot\u894  what awful laws have been brought about by\'a0women's vote\u894  the conditions that prevail in the homes\'a0and how deeply\'a0women get interested in politics, because women are hysterical, and we can not think\'a0of anything else, we just forget our families, cease to care for\'a0our\'a0children, cease to love our husbands and just go to the polls and vote and keep on voting for\'a0 ten hours a day\'a0365 days in the year, never\'a0let up, if we ever get to the polls once you will never\'a0get us\'a0 home, so that the women will not vote at all, and they\'a0will not do anything but vote. Now these are two very\'a0 strong anti\'adsuffrage arguments and they can prove them\'a0by\'a0figures. Then they\'a0will tell you that if women are permitted to vote it will be a great expense and no use because wives will vote just as their husbands do\u894  even if we have no husbands, that would not effect the result because we would vote just as our\'a0husbands\'a0 would vote if we had one. How I wish the anti\'adsuffragists could make the men believe that\u894  if they\'a0could make men believe that the women would vote just as they\'a0wanted them to do you think we would ever have to make another\'a0speech or\'a0hold another meeting, we would have to vote whether\'a0we wanted to or\'a0not. And then the very one who will tell you that women will vote just as their\'a0husbands do will tell you in five minutes\'a0that they\'a0will not vote as their husbands will and then the discord in the homes, and the divorce. Why, they\'a0have discovered that in Colorado there are more divorces than there were before women began to vote, but they\'a0have forgotten to tell you that there are four\'a0times as many\'a0people in Colorado today\'a0as\'a0 there were when women began to vote, and that may have some effect, particularly as these people went from the East. Then they\'a0will tell you all the trouble that happens in the home. A\'a0gentleman told me that in California [missing text] and when he was talking I had a wonderful thing pass\'a0 through my\'a0mind, because he said that he and his wife had lived together\'a0for\'a0twenty\'a0years and never had a difference in opinion in the whole twenty\'a0years and he was afraid if women began to vote that his wife would vote differently\'a0from\'a0him\'a0and then that beautiful harmony\'a0which they\'a0had had for twenty\'a0years would be broken, and all the time he was talking I could not help wondering which was the idiot because I knew that no intelligent human beings could live together for\'a0twenty\'a0years and not have a differences of opinion. All the time he was talking I looked at that splendid type of manhood and thought, how would a man feel being tagged up by\'a0a little woman for twenty\'a0years saying, "Me\'a0too, me too." I would not want to live in a house with a human being for twenty\'a0years who agreed with everything I said. The stagnation of a frog pond would be hilarious compared to that. What a reflection is that on men. If we should say\'a0that about men we would never hear\'a0the last of it. Now it may\'a0be that the kind of men being that the anti\'adsuffragists live with is\'a0 that kind, but they are not the kind we live with and we could not do it. Great big overgrown babies! Cannot be disputed without having a row! While we do not believe that men are saints, by\'a0any\'a0means, we do believe that the average American man is a fairly good sort of fellow. In fact my theory\'a0of the whole matter is exactly opposite, because instead of believing that men and women will quarrel, I think\'a0just the opposite thing will happen. I think\'a0just about six\'a0weeks before election a sort of honeymoon will start and it will continue until they\'a0will think\'a0they are again hanging over\'a0the gate, all in order\'a0 to get each other's votes. When men want each other's votes they\'a0do not go up and knock\'a0them down\u894  they\'a0 are very\'a0solicitous of each other, if they\'a0are thirsty\'a0or need a smoke or\'a0[missing text] well we don't worry\'a0 about home. The husband and wife who are quarreling after\'a0the vote are quarreling now. Then the other\'a0belief that the women would not vote if they\'a0had a vote and would not do anything else\u894  and would vote just as their husbands vote, and would not vote like their husbands\u894  that women have so many\'a0 burdens that they\'a0cannot bear\'a0another\'a0burden, and that women are the leisure class. I remember\'a0having Reverend Dr. Abbott speak\'a0before the anti\'adsuffrage meeting in Brooklyn and he stated that if women were permitted to vote we would not have so much time for charity\'a0and philanthropy, and I would like to say, "Thank\'a0God, there will not be so much need of charity\'a0and philanthropy."\'a0The end and aim\'a0 of the suffrage is not to furnish an opportunity\'a0for\'a0excellent old ladies to be charitable. There are two words\'a0 that we ought to be able to get along without, and they\'a0are charity\'a0and philanthropy. They are not needed in a Republic. If we put in the word "opportunity"\'a0instead, that is what Republics stand for. Our\'a0doctrine is not to extend the length of our\'a0bread lines or\'a0the size of our soup kitchens, what we need is\'a0 for men to have the opportunity to buy their\'a0own bread and eat their own soup. We women have used up our\'a0lives and strength in fool charities, and we have made more paupers than we have ever\'a0helped by\'a0the folly\'a0of our\'a0charities and philanthropies\u894  the unorganized methods by\'a0which we deal with the conditions of society, and instead of giving people charity we must learn to give them\'a0an opportunity\'a0to develop and make themselves capable of earning the bread\u894  no human being has the right to live without toil\u894  toil of some kind, and that old theory\'a0that we used to hear\'a0"The world owes a man a living"\'a0never\'a0was true and never\'a0will be true. This world does not owe anybody\'a0a living, what it does owe to every\'a0human being is the opportunity\'a0to earn a living. We have a right to the opportunity\'a0and then the right to the living thereafter. We want it. No woman, any\'a0more than a man, has the right to live an idle life in this world, we must learn to give back\'a0 something for\'a0the space occupied and we must do our\'a0duty\'a0wherever duty\'a0calls, and the woman herself must decide where her\'a0duty\'a0calls, just as a man does. Now they\'a0tell us we should not vote because we have not the time, we are so burdened that we should not have any\'a0more burdens. Then, if that is so, I think\'a0we ought to allow the women to vote instead of the men, since we pay\'a0a man anywhere from a third to a half more than we do women it would be better\'a0to use up the cheap time of the women instead of the dear\'a0time of the men. And talking about time you would think it took\'a0 about a week\'a0to vote. A\'a0dear, good friend of mine in Omaha said, "Now Miss. Shaw,"\'a0and she held up her\'a0child in her\'a0arms, "is not this my\'a0job."\'a0I said it certainly is, and then she said, "How can I go to the polls and vote and neglect my\'a0 baby?"\'a0I said, "Has your\'a0husband a job?"\'a0and she said, "Why you know he has."\'a0I did know it\u894  he was a banker\'a0and a very\'a0busy\'a0one. I said, "Yet your\'a0husband said he was going to leave husband and go down to the polls and vote,"\'a0and she said, "Oh yes, he is so very\'a0interested in election." Then I said, "What an advantage you have over your\'a0husband, he has to leave his job and you can take your\'a0job with you and you do not need to neglect your\'a0job."\'a0Is it not strange that the only\'a0time a woman might neglect her\'a0baby\'a0is on election day, and then the dear\'a0old Antis hold up their\'a0hands and say, "You have neglected your\'a0baby."\'a0A\'a0 woman can belong to a whist club and go once a week\'a0and play\'a0whist, she cannot take her\'a0baby\'a0to the whist club, and she has to keep whist herself without trying to keep a baby\'a0whist. She can go to the theatre, to church or\'a0a picnic and no one is worrying about the baby, but to vote and everyone cries out about the neglect. You would think\'a0on Election Day\'a0that a woman grabbed up her\'a0baby\'a0and started out and just dropped it somewhere and paid no attention to it. It used to be asked when we had the question [missing text] box, "Who will take care of the babies?"\'a0I did not know what person could be got to take care of all the babies, so I thought I would go out West and find out. I went to Denver\'a0and I found that they\'a0took care of their\'a0babies\'a0 just the same on election day\'a0as they\'a0did on every\'a0other\'a0day\u894  they\'a0took their\'a0baby\'a0along with them, when they\'a0went to put a letter\'a0in a box\'a0they\'a0took\'a0their baby\'a0along and when they\'a0went to put their\'a0ballot in the box\'a0 they\'a0took\'a0their baby\'a0along. If the mother\'a0had to stand in line and the baby got restless she would joggle the go\'adcart and when she went in to vote a neighbor\'a0would joggle the go\'adcart and if there was no neighbor\'a0there was the candidate and he would joggle the cart. That is one day\'a0in the year\'a0when you can get a hundred people to take care of any\'a0number\'a0of babies. I have never worried about the babies on Election Day\'a0since that time. Then the people will tell you that women are so burdened with their duties that they can not vote, and they\'a0 will tell you that women are the leisure class and the men are worked to death: but the funniest argument of the lady who followed me about in the West: Out there they\'a0were great in the temperance question, and she declared that we were not prohibition, or\'a0she declared that we were. Now in North Dakota which is one of the first prohibition states, and they\'a0are dry\'a0because they\'a0want to be dry. In that state she wanted to prove to them\'a0that if women were allowed to vote they\'a0would vote North Dakota wet and she had her\'a0figures\u894  that women had not voted San Francisco dry, or Portland dry, or\'a0Chicago dry. Of course we had not voted on the question in Chicago, but that did not matter. Then we went to Montana, which is wet. They have it wet there because they\'a0want it wet, so that any\'a0 argument that she could bring to bear\'a0upon them\'a0to prove that we would make North Dakota wet and keep it wet would have given us\'a0the state, but that would not work, so she brought out the figures out of her pocket to prove to the men of Montana that if women were allowed to vote in Montana they\'a0would vote Montana dry. She proved that in two years in Illinois they had voted ninety\'adsix\'a0towns dry, and that at that rate we would soon get over Montana and have it dry. Then I went to Nebraska and as soon as I reached there a reporter\'a0came and asked me the question, "How are the women going to vote on the prohibition question?"\'a0I said, "I really\'a0don't know. I know how we will vote in North Dakota, we will vote wet in North Dakota\u894  in Montana we will vote dry, but how we will vote in Nebraska, I don't know, but I will let you know just as soon as the lady\'a0from\'a0New Jersey\'a0comes."\'a0 We will either\'a0vote as our\'a0husbands vote or we will not vote as our\'a0husbands vote. We either\'a0have time to vote or\'a0we don't have time to vote. We will either\'a0not vote at all or\'a0we will vote all the time. It reminds me of the story\'a0of the old Irish woman who had twin boys and they\'a0were so much alike that the neighbors could not tell them apart, so one of the neighbors said, "\'a0Now Mrs. Mahoney, you have two of the finest twin boys I ever\'a0saw in all my\'a0life, but how do you know them\'a0apart."\'a0"Oh," she says, "That's easy\'a0enough any\'a0one could tell them\'a0apart. When I want to know which is which I just put my\'a0finger\'a0in Patsey's mouth and if he bites it is Mikey."\'a0 Now what does it matter whether\'a0the women will vote as their\'a0husbands do or\'a0will not vote\u894  whether\'a0they\'a0 have time or\'a0have not\u894  or whether\'a0they\'a0will vote for prohibition or not. What has that to do with the fundamental question of democracy, no one has yet discovered. Bu they\'a0cannot argue on that\u894  they\'a0cannot argue on the fundamental basis of our existence so that they\'a0have to get off on all of these side tricks to get anything approaching an argument. So they\'a0tell you that democracy is a form of government. It is not. It was\'a0 before governments were\u894  it will prevail when governments cease to be\u894  it is more than a form of government\u894  it is a great spiritual force emanating from the heart of the Infinite, transforming human character\'a0until some day, some day\'a0in the distant future, man by\'a0the power\'a0of the spirit of democracy, will be able to look\'a0back into the face of the Infinite and answer, as man can not answer\'a0today, "\'a0One is our\'a0Father, even God, and all we people are the children of one family."\'a0 And when democracy\'a0has taken possession of human lives no man will ask\'a0from him to grant to his\'a0 neighbor, whether\'a0that neighbor\'a0be a man or\'a0woman\u894  no man will then be willing to allow another\'a0man to rise to power\'a0on his shoulders, nor\'a0will he be willing to rise to power\'a0on the shoulders of another\'a0prostrate human being. Bu that has not yet taken possession of us, but some day\'a0we will be free, and we are getting nearer\'a0and nearer\'a0to it all the time\u894  and never in the history\'a0of our\'a0country had the men and women of this\'a0 nation a better\'a0right to approach it than they\'a0have today\u894  never\'a0in the history\'a0of the nation did it stand out so splendidly\'a0as it stands today, and never ought we men and women to be more grateful for anything than that there presides in the White House today\'a0a man of peace. As so our\'a0good friends go on with one thing after\'a0another\'a0and they\'a0say\'a0if women should vote they\'a0will have to sit on the jury\'a0and they\'a0ask\'a0whether\'a0we will like to see a woman sitting on a jury. I have seen some juries\'a0 that ought to be sat on and I have seen some women that would be glad to sit on anything. When a woman stands up all day\'a0behind a counter, or when she stands\'a0all day\'a0doing a washing she is glad enough to sit\u894  and when she stands for\'a0seventy\'adfive cents she would like to sit for\'a0two dollars a day. But don't you think we need some women on juries in this country? You read your\'a0paper\'a0and you read that one day\'a0last week\'a0or\'a0the week\'a0before or\'a0the week\'a0before a little girl went out to school and never came back\u894  another\'a0little girl was sent on an errand and never\'a0came back\u894  another\'a0little girl was left in charge of a little sister\'a0and her\'a0mother\'a0went out to work\'a0and when she returned the little girl was not there, and you read it over and over\'a0again, and the horror\'a0of it strikes you. You read that in these United States five thousand young girls go out and never come back, don't you think\'a0 that the men and women the vampires of our country who fatten and grow rich on the ignorance and innocence of children would rather\'a0face Satan himself than a jury\'a0of mothers. I would like to see some juries\'a0 of mothers. I lived in the slums of Boston for\'a0three years and I know the need of juries of mothers. Then they\'a0tell us that if women were permitted to vote that they\'a0would take office, and you would suppose that we just took\'a0office in this country. There is a difference of getting an office in this country\'a0and in Europe. In England, a man stands for Parliament and in this country\'a0he runs for\'a0Congress, and so long as it is a question of running for office I don't think\'a0women have much chance, especially with our\'a0present hobbles. There are some women who want to hold office and I may as well own up. I am one of them. I have been wanting to hold office for more than thirty\'ad five years. Thirty\'adfive years ago I lived in the slums of Boston and ever since then I have wanted to hold office. I have applied to the major\'a0to be made an officer\u894  I wanted to be the greatest office holder\'a0in the world, I wanted the position of the man I think\'a0is to be the most envied, as far as the ability\'a0to do good is concerned, and that is a policeman. I have always wanted to be a policeman and I have applied to be appointed policeman and the very first question that was asked me was, "Could you knock\'a0a man down and take him to jail?"\'a0 That is some people's idea of the highest service that a policeman can render\'a0a community. Knock\'a0 somebody\'a0down and take him to jail! My\'a0idea is not so much to arrest criminals as it is to prevent crime. That is what is needed in the police force of every community. When I lived for\'a0three years in the back\'a0alleys\'a0 of Boston. I saw there that it was needed to prevent crime and from\'a0that day? This I believe there is no great public gathering of any\'a0sort whatever where we do not need women on the police force\u894  we need them at every moving picture show, every\'a0dance house, every\'a0restaurant, every hotel, and every great store with a great bargain counter\'a0and every park\'a0and every resort where the vampires who fatten on the crimes and vices of men and women gather. We need women on the police force and we will have them there some day. If women vote, will they\'a0go to war? They\'a0are great on having us fight. They\'a0tell you that the government rests on force, but there are a great many\'a0kinds of force in this world, and never\'a0in the history of man were the words of the Scriptures proved to the extent that they\'a0are today, that the men of the nation that lives by\'a0 the sword shall die by the sword. When I was speaking in North Dakota from\'a0an automobile with a great crowd and a great number\'a0of men gathered around a man who had been sitting in front of a store whittling a stick\'a0called out to another\'a0man and asked if women get the vote will they\'a0go over\'a0to Germany\'a0and fight the Germans? I said, "Why no, why\'a0should we go over to Germany and fight Germans?"\'a0"If Germans come over\'a0 here would you fight?" I said, "Why\'a0should we women fight men, but if Germany should send an army\'a0of women over here, then we would show you what we would do. We would go down and meet them and say, "Come on, let's go up to the opera house and talk\'a0this matter\'a0over."\'a0It might grow wearisome but it would not be death. Would it not be better\'a0if the heads of the governments in Europe had talked things over? What might have happened to the world if a dozen men had gotten together\'a0in Europe and settled the awful controversy, which is today\'a0discriminating the nations of Europe? We women got together\'a0there last year, over in Rome, the delegates from twenty\'adeight different nations of women, and for two weeks we discussed problems\'a0 which had like interests to us all.  They\'a0were all kinds of Protestants, both kinds of Catholics, Roman, and Greek, three were Jews and Mohamedans, but we were not there to discuss our\'a0different religious beliefs, but we were there to discuss\'a0 the things that were of vital importance to us all, and at the end of the two weeks, after\'a0the discussions were over\'a0we passed a great number of resolutions. We discussed white slavery, the immigration laws, we discussed the spread of contagious and infectious\'a0 diseases\u894  we discussed various forms of education, and various forms of juvenile criminals, every question which every\'a0nation has to meet, and at the end of two weeks we passed many\'a0resolutions, but two of them\'a0 were passed unanimously. One was presented by\'a0myself as Chairman on the Committee on Suffrage and on that resolution we called upon all civilizations\'a0of the world to give to women equal rights with men and there was not a dissenting vote. The other\'a0resolution was on peace. We believed then and many of us believe today, notwithstanding all the discussion that is going on, we believe and we will continue to believe that preparedness for\'a0war\'a0is an incentive to war, and the only hope of permanent peace is the systematic and scientific\'a0disarmament of all the nations of the world, and we passed a resolution and passed it unanimously\'a0to that effect. A\'a0few days\'a0afterward I attended a large reception given by\'a0the American ambassador, and there was an Italian diplomat there and he spoke rather\'a0superciliously\'a0and said, " You women think\'a0you have been having a very\'a0remarkable convention, and I understand that a resolution on peace was offered by\'a0the Germans, the French women seconded it, and the British presiding presented it and it was carried unanimously." We none of us dreamed what was taking place at that time, but he knew and we learned it before we arrived home, that awful, awful thing that was about to sweep over\'a0the nations of the world. The American ambassador\'a0 replied to the Italian diplomat and said, "Yes Prince, it was a remarkable convention, and it is a remarkable thing that the only people who can get together\'a0internationally\'a0and discuss their\'a0various problems without acrimony\'a0and without a sword at their\'a0side are the women of the world, but we men, even when we go to the Hague to discuss peace, we go with a sword dangling at our\'a0side." It is remarkable that even at this age men can not discuss international problems and discuss them in peace. When I turned away\'a0from\'a0that place up in North Dakota that man in the crowd called out again, just as we were leaving, and said, "Well what does a woman know about war\'a0anyway?"\'a0I had read my paper\'a0that morning and I knew what the awful headline was, and I saw a gentleman standing in the crowd with a paper\'a0 in his pocket, and I said, "Will that gentleman hold the paper\'a0up."\'a0And he held it up, and the headline read, "250,000 Men Killed Since the War Began". I said, "You ask\'a0me what a woman knows about war? No woman can read that line and comprehend the awful horror\u894  no woman knows the significance of 250,000 dead men, but you tell me that one man lay\'a0dead and I might be able to tell you something of its awful meaning to one woman. I would know that years before a woman whose heart beat in unison with her\'a0love and her\'a0desire for\'a0 motherhood walked day\'a0by\'a0day\'a0with her\'a0face to an open grave, with courage, which no man has ever\'a0 surpassed, and if she did not fill that grave, if she lived, and if there was laid in her arms a tiny\'a0little bit of helpless humanity, I would know that there went out from\'a0her\'a0soul such a cry of thankfulness as none save a mother\'a0could know. And then I would know, what men have not yet learned that women are human\u894  that they\'a0have human hopes and human passions, aspirations and desires as men have, and I would know that that mother had laid aside all those hopes and aspirations for\'a0herself, laid them aside for\'a0her\'a0boy, and if after\'a0years had passed by\'a0she forgot her\'a0nights of sleeplessness and her\'a0days of fatiguing toil in her\'a0care of her\'a0growing boy, and when at last he became a man and she stood looking up into his eyes and beheld him, bone of her bone and flesh of her flesh, for\'a0out of her woman's life she had carved twenty\'a0beautiful years\'a0 that went into the making of a man\u894  and there he stands, the most wonderful thing in all the world\u894  for in all the Universe of God there is nothing more sublimely wonderful than a strong limbed, clean hearted, keen brained, aggressive young man, standing as he does on the border\'a0line of life, ready\'a0to reach out and grapple with its problems. O, how wonderful he is, and he is hers. She gave her\'a0life for\'a0him, and in an hour\'a0this country\'a0calls him\'a0out and in an hour\'a0he lies dead\u894  that wonderful, wonderful thing lies dead\u894  and sitting by his side, that mother\'a0 looking into the dark years to come knows that when her\'a0son died her\'a0life's hope died with him, and in the face of that wretched motherhood, what man dare ask\'a0what a woman knows of war. And that is not all. Read your\'a0papers, you can not read it because it is not printable\u894  you cannot tell it because it is not speakable, you cannot even think\'a0it because it is not thinkable, the horrible crimes perpetrated against women by\'a0the blood drunken men of the war. You read your\'a0paper\'a0again and the second headlines read, "It Costs Twenty\'a0Millions of Dollars a Day,"\'a0for\'a0 what? To buy\'a0the material to slaughter\'a0the splendid results of civilization of the centuries. Men whom\'a0it has\'a0 taken centuries to build up and make into great scientific\'a0forces of brain, the flower\'a0of the manhood of the great nations of Europe, and we spend twenty\'a0millions of dollars a day\'a0to blot out all the results of civilization of hundreds and hundreds of years. And what do we do? We lay\'a0a mortgage on every unborn child for a hundred and more years to come. Mortgage his brain, his brawn, and every\'a0pulse of his heart in order\'a0to pay\'a0the debt, to buy\'a0the material to slaughter\'a0the men of our\'a0country. And that is not all, the greatest crime of war\'a0is the crime against the unborn. Read what they\'a0are doing. They\'a0are calling out every\'a0man, every young man, and every virile man from\'a0seventeen to forty\'adfive or fifty\'a0 years old\u894  they\'a0are calling them\'a0out. All the splendid scientific force and energy\'a0of the splendid virile manhood are being called out to be food for\'a0the cannon, and they\'a0are leaving behind the degenerate, defective imbecile, the unfit, the criminals, the diseased to be the fathers of children yet to be born. The crime of crimes of the war\'a0is the crime against the unborn children, and in the face of the fact that women are driven out of the home shall men ask\'a0if women shall fight if they\'a0are permitted to vote. No, we women do not want the ballot in order\'a0that we may fight, but we do want the ballot in order that we may help men to keep from\'a0fighting, whether\'a0it is in the home or in the state, just as the home is not without the man, so the state is not without the woman, and you can no more build up homes without men than you can build up the state without women. We are needed everywhere where human problems are to be solved. Men and women must go through this world together\'a0from\'a0the cradle to the grave\u894  it is God's way\'a0and the fundamental principle of a Republican form of government.}
