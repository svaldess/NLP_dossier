Against Imperialism\
08 August 1900\
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Notification Committee: I shall, at an early day, and in a more formal manner, accept the nomination which you tender, and shall at that time discuss the various questions\'a0 covered by the Democratic platform. It may not be out of place, however, to submit a few observations at this time upon the general character of the contest before us and upon the question which is declared to be of paramount importance in this campaign. When I say\'a0that the contest of 1900 is a contest of 1900 is a contest between Democracy on the one hand and plutocracy\'a0on the other I do not mean to say\'a0that all our\'a0opponents have deliberately chosen to give to organized wealth a predominating influence in the affairs of the Government, but I do assert that on the important issues of the day the Republican party is dominated by those influences which constantly\'a0tend to substitute the worship of mammon for the protection of the rights of man. In 1859 Lincoln said that the Republican Party\'a0believed in the man and the dollar, but that in case of conflict it believed in the man before the dollar. This is the proper\'a0relation which should exist between the two. Man, the handiwork\'a0of God, comes first\uc0\u894  money, the handiwork\'a0of man, is of inferior\'a0importance. Man is the master, money\'a0the servant, but upon all important questions today\'a0Republican legislation tends to make money\'a0the master\'a0and man the servant. The maxim of Jefferson, \'93equal rights to all and special privileges to none,\'94\'a0and the doctrine of Lincoln that this should be a government \'93of the people, by the people and for the people,\'94\'a0are being disregarded and the instrumentalities of government are being used to advance the interests of those who are in a position to secure favors from the Government. The Democratic\'a0party\'a0is not making war\'a0upon the honest acquisition of wealth\u894  it has no desire to discourage industry, economy\'a0and thrift. On the contrary, it gives to every\'a0citizen the greatest possible stimulus\'a0to honest toil when it promises him protection in the enjoyment of the proceeds of his labor. Property\'a0rights are most secure when human rights are most respected. Democracy strives for civilization in which every\'a0member\'a0of society will share according to his merits. No one has a right to expect from a society\'a0more than a fair compensation for the services No one has a right to expect from\'a0a society more than a fair compensation for the services which he renders to society. If he secures more it is at the expense of some one else. It is no injustice to him\'a0to prevent his doing injustice to another. To him who would, either through class legislation or\'a0in the absence of necessary\'a0legislation, trespass upon the rights of another the Democratic party\'a0says "Thou shalt not."\'a0 Against us are arrayed a comparatively\'a0small but politically and financially\'a0powerful number\'a0who really\'a0profit by\'a0Republican policies\u894  but with them are associated a large number\'a0who, because of their\'a0attachment to their\'a0party\'a0name, are giving their\'a0support to doctrines antagonistic\'a0to the former teachings of their own party. Republicans who used to advocate bimetallism now try to convince themselves that the gold standard is\'a0 good\u894  Republicans who were formerly\'a0attached to the greenback\'a0are now seeking an excuse for\'a0giving national banks control of the nation's paper\'a0money\u894  Republicans who used to boast that the Republican party\'a0was paying off the national debt are now looking for\'a0reasons to support a perpetual and increasing debt\u894  Republicans who formerly abhorred a trust now beguile themselves with the delusion that there are good trusts, and bad trusts, while in their\'a0minds, the line between the two is becoming more and more obscure\u894  Republicans who, in times past, congratulated the country\'a0upon the small expense of our\'a0standing army, are now making light of the objections which are urged against a large increase in the permanent military establishment\u894  Republicans who gloried in our\'a0independence when the nation was less powerful now look\'a0with favor\'a0upon a foreign alliance\u894  Republicans who three years ago condemned "forcible annexation" as immoral and even criminal are now sure that it is both immoral and criminal to oppose forcible annexation. That partisanship has already\'a0blinded many to present dangers is certain\u894  how large a portion of the Republican party\'a0can be drawn over to the new policies remains to be seen. For\'a0a time Republican leaders were inclined to deny\'a0to opponents the right to criticize the Philippine policy\'a0 of the administration, but upon investigation they\'a0found that both Lincoln and Clay asserted and exercised the right to criticize a President during the progress of the Mexican war. Instead of meeting the issue boldly\'a0and submitting a clear\'a0and positive plan for dealing with the Philippine question, the Republican convention adopted a platform\'a0the larger\'a0part of which was devoted to boasting and self\'adcongratulation. In attempting to press economic\'a0questions upon the country\'a0to the exclusion of those which involve the very\'a0 structure of our\'a0government, the Republican leaders give new evidence of their\'a0abandonment of the earlier\'a0 ideals of their party\'a0and of their\'a0complete subserviency\'a0to pecuniary\'a0considerations.  But they shall not be permitted to evade the stupendous and far\'adreaching issue which they\'a0have deliberately\'a0 brought into the arena of politics. When the president, supported by\'a0a practically unanimous vote of the House and Senate, entered upon a war\'a0with Spain for\'a0the purpose of aiding the struggling patriots of Cuba, the country, without regard to party, applauded. Although the Democrats realized that the administration would necessarily\'a0gain a political advantage from\'a0 the conduct of a war\'a0which in the very\'a0nature of the case must soon end in a complete victory, they\'a0vied with the Republicans in the support which they\'a0gave to the president. When the war\'a0was over and the Republican leaders began to suggest the propriety\'a0of a colonial policy\'a0opposition at once manifested itself. When the President finally\'a0laid before the Senate a treaty\'a0which recognized the independence of Cuba, but provided for\'a0the cession of the Philippine Islands to the United States, the menace of imperialism became so apparent that many\'a0preferred to reject the treaty\'a0and risk\'a0the ills that might follow rather\'a0than take the chance of correcting the errors of the treaty by\'a0the independent action of this country. I was among the number\'a0of those who believed it better\'a0to ratify\'a0the treaty\'a0and end the war, release the volunteers, remove the excuse for\'a0war\'a0expenditures and then give the Filipinos the independence which might be forced from Spain by a new treaty. In view of the criticism which my action aroused in some quarters, I take this occasion to restate the reasons\'a0 given at that time. I thought it safer\'a0to trust the American people to give independence to the Filipinos than to trust the accomplishment of that purpose to diplomacy\'a0with an unfriendly\'a0nation. Lincoln embodied an argument in the question when he asked, "Can aliens make treaties easier\'a0than friends can make laws?"\'a0I believe that we are now in a better\'a0position to wage a successful contest against imperialism\'a0than we would have been had the treaty\'a0been rejected. With the treaty ratified a clean\'adcut issue is presented between a government by\'a0consent and a government by force, and imperialists must bear\'a0the responsibility for\'a0all that happens until the question is settled. If the treaty\'a0had been rejected the opponents of imperialism would have been held responsible for\'a0any\'a0 international complications which might have arisen before the ratification of another\'a0treaty. But whatever\'a0 difference of opinion may\'a0have existed as to the best method of opposing a colonial policy, there never was\'a0 any\'a0difference as to the great importance of the question and there is no difference now as to the course to be pursued. The title of Spain being extinguished we were at liberty\'a0to deal with the Filipinos according to American principles. The Bacon resolution, introduced a month before hostilities broke out at Manila, promised independence to the Filipinos on the same terms that it was promised to the Cubans. I supported this\'a0 resolution and believe that its adoption prior\'a0to the breaking out of hostilities would have prevented bloodshed, and that its adoption at any subsequent time would have ended hostilities. If the treaty\'a0had been rejected considerable time would have necessarily elapsed before a new treaty\'a0could have been agreed upon and ratified and during that time the question would have been agitating the public\'a0 mind. If the Bacon resolution had been adopted by\'a0the senate and carried out by\'a0the president, either\'a0at the time of the ratification of the treaty\'a0or at any\'a0time afterwards, it would have taken the question of imperialism out of politics and left the American people free to deal with their domestic problems. But the resolution was\'a0 defeated by the vote of the Republican Vice\'adPresident, and from\'a0that time to this a republican congress has\'a0 refused to take any\'a0action whatever in the matter. When hostilities broke out at Manila republican speakers and Republican editors at once sought to lay the blame upon those who had delayed the ratification of the treaty, and, during the progress of the war, the same republicans have accused the opponents of imperialism of giving encouragement to the Filipinos. This\'a0 is a cowardly\'a0evasion of responsibility. If it is right for\'a0the United States to hold the Philippine Islands permanently\'a0and imitate European empires in the government of colonies, the Republican party\'a0ought to state its position and defend it, but it must expect the subject races to protest against such a policy and to resist to the extent of their\'a0ability. The Filipinos do not need any\'a0encouragement from\'a0Americans now living. Our\'a0whole history\'a0has been an encouragement not only\'a0to the Filipinos, but to all who are denied a voice in their\'a0own government. If the republicans are prepared to censure all who have used language calculated to make the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them condemn the speech of Patrick\'a0Henry. When he uttered that passionate appeal, "Give me liberty or\'a0give me death," he expressed a sentiment which still echoes in the hearts of men. Let them censure Jefferson\u894  of all the statesmen of history\'a0none have used words so offensive to those who would hold their fellows in political bondage. Let them censure Washington, who declared that the colonists\'a0 must choose between liberty\'a0and slavery. Or, if the statute of limitations has run again the sins of Henry\'a0and Jefferson and Washington, let them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will be quoted in defense of popular\'a0government when the present advocates of force and conquest are forgotten. Some one has said that a truth once spoken, can never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can set a limit to its ever\'adwidening influence. But if it were possible to obliterate every word written or\'a0spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence, a war\'a0of conquest would still leave its\'a0 legacy\'a0of perpetual hatred, for it was God himself who placed in every\'a0human heart the love of liberty. He never\'a0made a race of people so low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it would welcome a foreign master. Those who would have this Nation enter\'a0upon a career\'a0of empire must consider, not only the effect of imperialism\'a0on the Filipinos, but they must also calculate its effects upon our\'a0own nation. We cannot repudiate the principle of self\'adgovernment in the Philippines without weakening that principle here. Lincoln said that the safety\'a0of this Nation was not in its fleets, its armies, or\'a0its forts, but in the spirit which prizes liberty as the heritage of all men, in all lands, everywhere, and he warned his countrymen that they\'a0 could not destroy\'a0this spirit without planting the seeds of despotism at their\'a0own doors. Even now we are beginning to see the paralyzing influence if imperialism. Heretofore this Nation has been prompt to express its sympathy\'a0with those who were fighting for civil liberty. While our\'a0sphere of activity\'a0has been limited to the Western Hemisphere, our\'a0sympathies have not been bounded by\'a0the seas. We have felt it due to ourselves and to the world, as well as to those who were struggling for the right to govern themselves, to proclaim\'a0the interest which our\'a0people have, from the date of their\'a0own independence, felt in every contest between human rights and arbitrary\'a0power. Three\'adquarters of a century ago, when our\'a0nation was small, the struggles of Greece aroused our\'a0people, and Webster\'a0and Clay\'a0gave eloquent expression to the universal desire for Grecian independence. In 1896 all parties manifested a lively interest in the success of the Cubans, but now when a war\'a0is in progress in South Africa, which must result in the extension of the monarchical idea, or\'a0in the triumph of a republic, the advocates of imperialism in this country\'a0dare not say\'a0a word in behalf of the Boers. Sympathy\'a0for\'a0the Boers does not arise from\'a0any\'a0unfriendliness towards\'a0England\u894  the American people are not unfriendly\'a0toward the people of any\'a0nation. This sympathy is due to the fact that, as stated in our\'a0 platform, we believe in the principles of self\'adgovernment and reject, as did our\'a0forefathers, the claims of monarchy. If this nation surrenders its belief in the universal application of the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence, it will lose the prestige and influence which it has enjoyed among the nations\'a0 as an exponent of popular government. Our\'a0opponents, conscious of the weakness of their cause, seek\'a0to confuse imperialism with expansion, and have even dared to claim\'a0Jefferson as a supporter\'a0of their\'a0policy. Jefferson spoke so freely and used language with such precision that no one can be ignorant of his views. On one occasion he declared: "If there be one principle more deeply rooted than any\'a0other\'a0in the mind of every\'a0American, it is that we should have nothing to do with conquest."\'a0And again he said: "Conquest is not in our\'a0principles\u894  it is inconsistent with our\'a0government."\'a0 The forcible annexation of territory\'a0to be governed by\'a0arbitrary power\'a0differs as much from\'a0the acquisition of territory\'a0to be built up into States as a monarchy\'a0differs from a democracy. The Democratic party does not oppose expansion when expansion enlarges the area of the Republic and incorporates land which can be settled by\'a0American citizens, or\'a0adds to our\'a0population people who are willing to become citizens and are capable of discharging their duties as such. The acquisition of the Louisiana territory, Florida, Texas and other\'a0tracts which have been secured from\'a0 time to time enlarged the republic\'a0and the Constitution followed the flag into the new territory. It is now proposed to seize upon distant territory\'a0already\'a0more densely\'a0populated than our\'a0own country\'a0and to force upon the people a government for\'a0which there is no warrant in our\'a0Constitution or our\'a0laws. Even the argument that this earth belongs to those who desire to cultivate it and who have the physical power\'a0to acquire it cannot be invoked to justify the appropriation of the Philippine Islands by\'a0the United States. If the islands were uninhabited American citizens would not be willing to go there and till the soil. The white race will not live so near\'a0the equator. Other\'a0nations have tried to colonize in the same latitude. The Netherlands have controlled Java for three hundred years and yet today\'a0there are less than sixty\'a0 thousand people of European birth scattered among the twenty\'adfive million natives. After\'a0a century and a half of English domination in India, less than one\'adtwentieth of one per\'a0cent of the people of India are of English birth, and it requires an army\'a0of seventy thousand British soldiers to take care of the tax collectors. Spain had asserted title to the Philippine Islands for\'a0three centuries and yet when our\'a0 fleet entered Manila bay\'a0there were less than ten thousand Spaniards residing in the Philippines. A\'a0colonial policy means that we shall send to the Philippine Islands a few traders, a few taskmasters and a few office\'adholders and an army large enough to support the authority of a small fraction of the people while they\'a0rule the natives. If we have an imperial policy\'a0we must have a great standing army\'a0as its natural and necessary\'a0complement. The sprit which will justify the forcible annexation of the Philippine Islands will justify\'a0the seizure of other\'a0 islands and the domination of other\'a0people, and with wars of conquest we can expect a certain, if not rapid, growth of our\'a0military establishment. That a large permanent increase in our regular\'a0army\'a0is intended by\'a0Republican leaders is not a matter\'a0of conjecture, but a matter of fact. In his message of December 5,1898, the president asked for authority\'a0to increase the standing army\'a0to 100,000. In 1896 the army contained about 25,000. Within two years the president asked for\'a0four times that many, and a Republican house of representatives complied with the request after the Spanish treaty\'a0had been signed, and when no country\'a0was at war\'a0with the United States. If such an army is demanded when an imperial policy is contemplated, but not openly avowed, what may\'a0be expected if the people encourage the Republican party by\'a0indorsing its policy\'a0at the polls? A\'a0large standing army\'a0is not only\'a0a pecuniary\'a0burden to the people and, if accompanied by\'a0compulsory\'a0 service, a constant source of irritation, but it is ever a menace to a Republican form\'a0of government. The army\'a0is the personification of force, and militarism\'a0will inevitably\'a0change the ideals of the people and turn the thoughts of our young men from\'a0the arts of peace to the science of war. The Government which relies for its defense upon its citizens is more likely\'a0to be just than one which has at call a large body\'a0of professional soldiers. A\'a0small standing army and a well\'adequipped and well\'addisciplined state militia are sufficient at ordinary\'a0times, and in an emergency\'a0the nation should in the future as in the past place its dependence upon the volunteers\'a0 who come from\'a0all occupations at their country's call and return to productive labor when their\'a0services are no longer\'a0required \'ad\'ad\'a0men who fight when the country\'a0needs fighters and work\'a0when the country\'a0needs\'a0 workers. The Republican platform\'a0assumes that the Philippine Islands will be retained under\'a0American sovereignty, and we have a right to demand of the republican leaders a discussion of the future status of the Filipino. Is he to be a citizen or a subject? Are we to bring into the body\'a0politic eight or\'a0ten million Asiatics so different from\'a0us in race and history\'a0that amalgamation is impossible? Are they\'a0to share with us in making the laws and shaping the destiny\'a0of this nation? No republican of prominence has been bold enough to advocate such a proposition. The McEnery resolution, adopted by\'a0the senate immediately\'a0after\'a0the ratification of the treaty, expressly\'a0 negatives this idea. The Democratic\'a0platform\'a0describes the situation when it says that the Filipinos cannot be citizens without endangering our\'a0civilization. Who will dispute it? And what is the alternative? If the Filipino is not to be a citizen, shall we make him\'a0a subject? On that question the Democratic platform\'a0 speaks with equal emphasis. It declares that the Filipino cannot be a subject without endangering our\'a0form\'a0 of government. A\'a0republic can have no subjects. A subject is possible only in a government resting upon force\u894  he is unknown in a government derived without consent and taxation without representation. The Republican platform\'a0says that "the largest measure of self\'adgovernment consistent with their\'a0welfare and our\'a0duties shall be secured to them (the Filipinos)\'a0by\'a0law."\'a0This is a strange doctrine for a government which owes its very existence to the men who offered their lives as a protest against government without consent and taxation without representation. In what respect does the position of the Republican party differ from\'a0the position taken by the English Government in 1776? Did not the English Government promise a good government to the colonists? What king ever\'a0promised a bad government to his people? Did not the English Government promise that the colonists should have the largest measure of self\'adgovernment consistent with their\'a0welfare and English duties? Did not the Spanish Government promise to give to the Cubans the largest measure of self\'adgovernment consistent with their\'a0welfare and Spanish duties? The whole difference between a monarchy and a republic\'a0may\'a0be summed up in one sentence. In a monarchy\'a0the king gives to the people what he believes to be a good government\u894  in a republic the people secure for themselves what they\'a0believe to be a good government. The Republican party\'a0has accepted the European idea and planted itself upon the ground taken by\'a0George III., and by\'a0every\'a0ruler who distrusts the capacity\'a0of the people for\'a0self\'adgovernment or\'a0denies them\'a0a voice in their\'a0own affairs. The Republican platform\'a0promises that some measure of self\'adgovernment is to be given the Filipinos by\'a0law\u894  but even this pledge is not fulfilled. Nearly sixteen months elapsed after\'a0the ratification of the treaty\'a0before the adjournment of congress last June and yet no law was passed dealing with the Philippine situation. The will of the president has been the only\'a0law in the Philippine islands wherever the American authority\'a0 extends. Why\'a0does the Republican party\'a0hesitate to legislate upon the Philippine question? Because a law would disclose the radical departure from\'a0history and precedent contemplated by\'a0those who control the Republican party. The storm of protest which greeted the Puerto Rican bill was an indication of what may be expected when the American people are brought face to face with legislation upon this subject. If the Puerto Ricans, who welcomed annexation, are to be denied the guarantees of our\'a0Constitution, what is to be the lot of the Filipinos, who resisted our\'a0authority? If secret influences could compel a disregard of our\'a0plain duty\'a0toward friendly people, living near\'a0our\'a0shores, what treatment will those same influences\'a0 provide for unfriendly\'a0people 7,000 miles away? If, in this country\'a0where the people have a right to vote, republican leaders dare not take the side of the people against the great monopolies which have grown up within the last few years, how can they\'a0be trusted to protect the Filipinos from the corporations which are waiting to exploit the islands? Is the sunlight of full citizenship to be enjoyed by the people of the United States, and the twilight of semi\'ad\'a0 citizenship endured by\'a0the people of Puerto Rico, while the thick darkness of perpetual vassalage covers\'a0 the Philippines? The Puerto Rico tariff law asserts the doctrine that the operation of the constitution is\'a0 confined to the forty\'adfive states. The Democratic\'a0party\'a0disputes this doctrine and denounces it as repugnant to both the letter and spirit of our\'a0organic\'a0law. There is no place in our\'a0system\'a0of government for\'a0the deposit of arbitrary\'a0and irresponsible power. That the leaders of a great party\'a0should claim\'a0for\'a0any\'a0president or\'a0congress the right to treat millions\'a0 of people as mere "possessions"\'a0and deal with them unrestrained by\'a0the constitution or\'a0the bill of rights\'a0 shows how far\'a0we have already\'a0departed from the ancient landmarks and indicates what may be expected if this nation deliberately enters upon a career\'a0of empire. The territorial form\'a0of government is temporary\'a0and preparatory, and the chief security a citizen of a territory\'a0 has is found in the fact that he enjoys the same constitutional guarantees and is subject to the same general laws as the citizen of a state. Take away\'a0this security\'a0and his rights will be violated and his interests\'a0 sacrificed at the demand of those who have political influence. This is the evil of the colonial system, no matter\'a0by what nation it is applied. What is our\'a0title to the Philippine Islands? Do we hold them by treaty\'a0or\'a0by conquest? Did we buy\'a0them or\'a0 did we take them? Did we purchase the people? If not, how did we secure title to them? Were they\'a0thrown in with the land? Will the Republicans say\'a0that inanimate earth has value but that when that earth is molded by\'a0 the divine hand and stamped with the likeness of the Creator\'a0it becomes a fixture and passes with the soil? If governments derive their\'a0just powers from the consent of the governed, it is impossible to secure title to people, either\'a0by\'a0force or by\'a0purchase. We could extinguish Spain's title by\'a0treaty, but if we hold title we must hold it by some method consistent with our\'a0ideas of government. When we made allies of the Filipinos\'a0 and armed them to fight against Spain, we disputed Spain's title. If we buy\'a0Spain's title we are not innocent purchasers. There can be no doubt that we accepted and utilized the services of the Filipinos, and that when we did so we had full knowledge that they\'a0were fighting for\'a0their own independence, and I submit that history\'a0furnishes\'a0 no example of turpitude baser\'a0than ours if we now substitute our\'a0yoke for the Spanish yoke. Let us consider\'a0briefly\'a0the reasons which have been given in support of an imperialistic\'a0policy. Some say\'a0 that it is our\'a0duty to hold the Philippine Islands. But duty\'a0is not an argument\u894  it is a conclusion. To ascertain what our\'a0duty\'a0is, in any\'a0emergency, we must apply\'a0well settled and generally\'a0accepted principles. It is our\'a0 duty\'a0to avoid stealing, no matter\'a0whether\'a0the thing to be stolen is of great or\'a0little value. It is our\'a0duty\'a0to avoid killing a human being, no matter where the human being lives or\'a0to what race or\'a0class he belongs. Every\'a0one recognizes the obligation imposed upon individuals to observe both the human and the moral law, but as some deny\'a0the application of those laws to nations, it may not be out of place to quote the opinions of others. Jefferson, than whom there is no higher\'a0political authority, said: "I know of but one code of morality\'a0for\'a0men, whether\'a0acting singly\'a0or collectively."\'a0 Franklin, whose learning, wisdom\'a0and virtue are a part of the priceless legacy\'a0bequeathed to use from\'a0the revolutionary\'a0days, expressed the same idea in even stronger\'a0language when he said: Justice is\'a0strictly due between neighbor\'a0nations\'a0as\'a0between neighbor\'a0citizens. A\'a0highwayman is as\'a0 much a robber\'a0when he plunders\'a0in a gang as\'a0when single\u894  and the nation that makes\'a0an unjust war\'a0 is\'a0only\'a0a great gang. Many\'a0may\'a0dare to do in crowds what they\'a0would not dare to do as individuals, but the moral character\'a0of an act is not determined by\'a0the number\'a0of those who join it. Force can defend a right, but force has never yet created a right. If it was true, as declared in the resolutions of intervention, that the Cubans "are and of right ought to be free and independent"\'a0(language taken from\'a0the Declaration of Independence), it is equally true that the Filipinos "are and of right ought to be free and independent."\'a0 The right of the Cubans to freedom was not based upon their proximity\'a0to the United States, nor upon the language which they\'a0spoke, nor\'a0yet upon the race or\'a0races to which they\'a0belonged. Congress by\'a0a practically\'a0unanimous vote declared that the principles\'a0enunciated at Philadelphia in 1776 were still alive and applicable to the Cubans. Who will draw a line between the natural rights of the Cubans and the Filipinos? Who will say\'a0that the former has a right to liberty\'a0and that the latter\'a0has no rights which we are bound to respect? And, if the Filipinos "are and of right ought to be free and independent,"\'a0what right have we to force our\'a0government upon them\'a0without their consent? Before our\'a0duty can be ascertained their\'a0 rights must be determined, and when their\'a0rights are once determined it is as much our duty\'a0to respect those rights as it was the duty\'a0of Spain to respect the rights of the people of Cuba or\'a0the duty\'a0of England to respect the rights of the American colonists. Rights never\'a0conflict\u894  duties never\'a0clash. Can it be our duty\'a0to usurp political rights which belong to others? Can it be our\'a0duty\'a0to kill those who, following the example of our\'a0forefathers, love liberty\'a0well enough to fight for\'a0it? A\'a0poet has described the terror\'a0which overcame a soldier\'a0who in the midst of the battle discovered that he had slain his brother. It is written "All ye are brethren." Let us hope for\'a0the coming day\'a0when human life \'ad\'ad\'a0 which when once destroyed cannot be restored \'ad\'ad\'a0will be so sacred that it will never\'a0be taken except when necessary\'a0to punish a crime already committed, or to prevent a crime about to be committed. It is said that we have assumed before the world obligations which make it necessary\'a0for us to permanently\'a0 maintain a government in the Philippine Islands. I reply first, that the highest obligation of this nation is to be true to itself. No obligation to any particular nations, or\'a0to all the nations combined, can require the abandonment of our theory\'a0of government, and the substitution of doctrines against which our\'a0whole national life has been a protest. And, second, that our\'a0obligation to the Filipinos, who inhabit the islands, is\'a0 greater\'a0than any\'a0obligation which we can owe to foreigners who have a temporary residence in the Philippines or\'a0desire to trade there. It is argued by\'a0some that the Filipinos are incapable of self\'adgovernment and that, therefore, we owe it to the world to take control of them. Admiral Dewey, in an official report to the Navy\'a0Department, declared the Filipinos more capable of self\'adgovernment than the Cubans and said that he based his opinion upon a knowledge of both races. But I will not rest the case upon the relative advancement of the Filipinos. Henry\'a0 Clay, in defending the right of the people of South America to self\'adgovernment said: It is\'a0the doctrine of thrones\'a0that man is\'a0too ignorant to govern himself. Their\'a0partisans\'a0assert his\'a0 incapacity\'a0in reference to all nations\u894  if they\'a0cannot command universal assent to the proposition, it is\'a0then demanded to particular\'a0nations\u894  and our pride and our\'a0presumption too often make converts\'a0 of us. I contend that it is\'a0to arraign the disposition of Providence himself to suppose that he has\'a0 created beings\'a0incapable of governing themselves, and to be trampled on by\'a0kings. Self\'ad\'a0 government is\'a0the natural government of man. Clay\'a0was right. There are degrees of proficiency in the art of self\'adgovernment, but it is a reflection upon the Creator\'a0to say\'a0that he denied to any\'a0people the capacity\'a0for\'a0self\'adgovernment. Once admit that some people are capable of self\'adgovernment and that others are not and that the capable people have a right to seize upon and govern the incapable, and you make force \'ad\'ad\'a0brute force \'ad\'ad\'a0the only\'a0foundation of government and invite the reign of a despot. I am\'a0not willing to believe that an all\'adwise and an all\'adloving God created the Filipinos and then left them\'a0thousands of years helpless until the islands attracted the attention of European nations. Republicans ask, "Shall we haul down the flag that floats over\'a0our\'a0dead in the Philippines?"\'a0The same question might have been asked, when the American flag floated over Chapultepec\'a0and waved over the dead who fell there\u894  but the tourist who visits the City of Mexico finds there a national cemetery owned by\'a0 the United States and cared for by\'a0an American citizen. Our flag still floats over our\'a0dead, but when the treaty\'a0with Mexico was signed American authority\'a0withdrew to the Rio Grande, and I venture the opinion that during the last fifty\'a0years the people of Mexico have made more progress under\'a0the stimulus of independence and self\'adgovernment than they\'a0would have made under\'a0a carpet\'adbag government held in place by\'a0bayonets. The United States and Mexico, friendly\'a0republics, are each stronger\'a0and happier\'a0than they\'a0would have been had the former been cursed and the latter\'a0crushed by\'a0an imperialistic policy disguised as "benevolent assimilation."\'a0 \'93Can we not govern colonies?\'94\'a0we are asked. The question is not what we can do, but what we ought to do. This nation can do whatever\'a0it desires to do, but it must accept responsibility for what it does. If the Constitution stands in the way, the people can amend the Constitution. I repeat, the nation can do whatever\'a0 it desires to do, but it cannot avoid the natural and legitimate results\'a0of it own conduct. The young man upon reaching his majority\'a0can do what he pleases. He can disregard the teachings of his\'a0 parents\u894  he can trample upon all that he has been taught to consider\'a0sacred\u894  he can disobey\'a0the laws of the State, the laws of society and the laws of God. He can stamp failure upon his life and make his very\'a0 existence a curse to his fellow men, and he can bring his father\'a0and mother\'a0in sorrow to the grave\u894  but he cannot annul the sentence, \'93The wages of sin is death.\'94\'a0 And so with the nation. It is of age and it can do what it pleases\u894  it can spurn the traditions of the past\u894  it can repudiate the principles upon which the nation rests\u894  it can employ\'a0force instead of reason\u894  it can substitute might for\'a0right\u894  it can conquer\'a0weaker\'a0people\u894  it can exploit their\'a0lands, appropriate their property\'a0and kill their\'a0people\u894  but it cannot repeal the moral law or\'a0escape the punishment decreed for\'a0the violation of human rights. Would we tread in the paths\'a0of tyranny, Nor\'a0reckon the tyrant's cost? Who taketh another's\'a0liberty\'a0 His\'a0freedom\'a0is\'a0also lost. Would we win as the strong have ever\'a0won, Make ready\'a0to pay the debt, For\'a0the God who reigned over\'a0Babylon Is\'a0the God who is reigning yet. Some argue that American rule in the Philippine Islands will result in the better\'a0education of the Filipinos. Be not deceived. If we expect to maintain a colonial policy, we shall not find it to our\'a0advantage to educate the people. The educated Filipinos are now in revolt against us, and the most ignorant ones have made the least resistance to our\'a0domination. If we are to govern them\'a0without their consent and give them\'a0no voice in determining the taxes which they\'a0must pay, we dare not educate them, lest they learn to read the Declaration of Independence and Constitution of the United States and mock\'a0us for\'a0our inconsistency. The principal arguments, however, advanced by\'a0those who enter\'a0upon a defense of imperialism are: First \'ad\'ad\'a0That we must improve the present opportunity\'a0to become a world power\'a0and enter\'a0into international politics. Second \'ad\'ad\'a0That our\'a0commercial interests in the Philippine Islands and in the Orient make it necessary\'a0for us\'a0 to hold the islands permanently. Third \'ad\'ad\'a0That the spread of the Christian religion will be facilitated by a colonial policy. Fourth \'ad\'ad\'a0That there is no honorable retreat from\'a0the position which the nation has taken. The first argument is addrest to the nation\'92s pride and the second to the nation\'92s pocket\'adbook. The third is\'a0 intended for\'a0the church member\'a0and the fourth for\'a0the partisan. It is sufficient answer\'a0to the first argument to say\'a0that for\'a0more than a century\'a0this nation has been a world power. For ten decades it has been the most potent influence in the world. Not only\'a0has it been a world power, but it has done more to shape the politics of the human race than all the other\'a0nations of the world combined. Because our\'a0Declaration of Independence was promulgated others have been promulgated. Because the patriots of 1776 fought for\'a0liberty other\'a0have fought for it. Because our\'a0Constitution was\'a0 adopted other\'a0constitutions have been adopted. The growth of the principle of self\'adgovernment, planted on American soil, has been the overshadowing political fact of the nineteenth century. It has made this nation conspicuous among the nations and given it a place in history\'a0such as no other\'a0nation has ever enjoyed. Nothing has been able to check the onward march of this idea. I am\'a0not willing that this nation shall cast aside the omnipotent weapon of truth to seize again the weapons of physical warfare. I would not exchange the glory\'a0of this Republic for the glory\'a0of all empires that have risen and fallen since time began. The permanent chairman of the last Republican Nation Convention presented the pecuniary\'a0argument in all its baldness when he said: We make no hypocritical pretense of being interested in the Philippines\'a0solely\'a0on account of others. While we regard the welfare of those people as\'a0a sacred trust, we regard the welfare of American people first. We see our\'a0duty to ourselves\'a0as well as\'a0to others. We believe in trade expansion. By\'a0 every\'a0legitimate means\'a0within the province of government and constitution we mean to stimulate the expansion of our\'a0trade and open new markets. This is the commercial argument. It is based upon the theory\'a0that war\'a0can be rightly\'a0waged for pecuniary\'a0 advantage, and that it is profitable to purchase trade by\'a0force and violence. Franklin denied both of these propositions. When Lord Howe asserted that the acts of Parliament which brought on the Revolution were necessary\'a0to prevent American trade from\'a0passing into foreign channels, Franklin replied: To me it seems that neither\'a0the obtaining nor\'a0retaining of any\'a0trade, howsoever\'a0valuable, is\'a0an object for\'a0which men may\'a0justly spill each other's\'a0blood\u894  that the true and sure means\'a0of extending and securing commerce are the goodness\'a0and cheapness\'a0of commodities, and that the profits of no trade can ever\'a0be equal to the expense of compelling it and holding it by\'a0fleets\'a0and armies. I consider\'a0this\'a0war against us, therefore, as\'a0both unjust and unwise. I place the philosophy\'a0of Franklin against the sordid doctrine of those who would put a price upon the head of an American soldier\'a0and justify a war\'a0of conquest upon the ground that it will pay. The democratic\'a0party\'a0is\'a0 in favor of the expansion of trade. It would extend our\'a0trade by\'a0every legitimate and peaceful means\u894  but it is\'a0 not willing to make merchandise of human blood. But a war\'a0of conquest is as unwise as it is unrighteous. A\'a0harbor\'a0and coaling station in the Philippines would answer\'a0every trade and military necessity\'a0and such a concession could have been secured at any\'a0time without difficulty. It is not necessary\'a0to own people in order\'a0to trade with them. We carry on trade today\'a0with every part of the world, and our\'a0commerce has expanded more rapidly\'a0than the commerce of any\'a0European empire. We do not own Japan or\'a0China, but we trade with their people. We have not absorbed the republics of Central and South America, but we trade with them. It has not been necessary\'a0to have any\'a0political connection with Canada or\'a0the nations of Europe in order\'a0to trade with them. Trade cannot be permanently\'a0profitable unless\'a0 it is voluntary. When trade is secured by\'a0force, the cost of securing it and retaining it must be taken out of the profits and the profits are never large enough to cover\'a0the expense. Such a system\'a0would never be defended but for\'a0 the fact that the expense is borne by\'a0all the people, while the profits are enjoyed by a few. Imperialism would be profitable to the army\'a0contractors\u894  it would be profitable to the ship owners, who would carry\'a0live soldiers to the Philippines and bring dead soldiers back\u894  it would be profitable to those who would seize upon the franchises, and it would be profitable to the officials whose salaries would be fixed here and paid over\'a0there\u894  but to the farmer, to the laboring man and to the vast majority of those engaged in other\'a0 occupations it would bring expenditure without return and risk\'a0without reward. Farmers and laboring men have, as a rule, small incomes and under\'a0systems which place the tax upon consumption pay\'a0much more than their\'a0fair share of the expenses of government. Thus the very\'a0people who receive least benefit from\'a0imperialism\'a0will be injured most by\'a0the military\'a0burdens which accompany\'a0it. In addition to the evils which he and the farmer\'a0share in common, the laboring man will be the first to suffer\'a0 if oriental subjects seek\'a0work\'a0in the United States\u894  the first to suffer\'a0if American capital leaves our\'a0shores to employ\'a0oriental labor\'a0in the Philippines to supply\'a0the trade of China and Japan\u894  the first to suffer\'a0from the violence which the military spirit arouses and the first to suffer when the methods of imperialism are applied to our\'a0own government. It is not strange, therefore, that the labor\'a0organizations have been quick\'a0to note the approach of these dangers and prompt to protest against both militarism and imperialism. The pecuniary\'a0argument, the more effective with certain classes, is not likely to be used so often or\'a0 presented with so much enthusiasm as the religious argument. If what has been termed the \'93gunpowder\'a0 gospel\'94\'a0were urged against the Filipinos only\'a0it would be a sufficient answer\'a0to say\'a0that a majority of the Filipinos are now members of one branch of the Christian church\u894  but the principle involved is one of much wider\'a0application and challenges serious consideration. The religious argument varies in positiveness from\'a0a passive belief that Providence delivered the Filipinos\'a0 into our\'a0hands, for their\'a0good and our\'a0glory, to the exultation of the minister\'a0who said that we ought to \'93thrash the natives (Filipinos)\'a0until they\'a0understand who we are,\'94\'a0and that \'93every bullet sent, every\'a0cannon shot and every\'a0flag waved means righteousness.\'94\'a0 We cannot approve of this doctrine in one place unless\'a0we are willing to apply\'a0it everywhere. If there is\'a0 poison in the blood of the hand it will ultimately\'a0reach the heat. It is equally\'a0true that forcible Christianity, if planted under\'a0the American flag in the far\'adaway\'a0Orient, will sooner\'a0or\'a0later be transplanted upon American soil. If true Christianity\'a0consists in carrying out in our\'a0daily\'a0lives the teachings of Christ, who will say\'a0that we are commanded to civilize with dynamite and proselyte with the sword? He who would declare the divine will must prove his authority\'a0either\'a0by Holy Writ or by\'a0evidence of a special dispensation. Imperialism finds no warrant in the Bible. The command, \'93Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature,\'94 has no Gatling gun attachment. When Jesus visited a village of Samaria and the people refused to receive him, some of the disciples suggested that fire should be called down from\'a0Heaven to avenge the insult\u894  but the Master\'a0rebuked them\'a0and said: \'93Ye know not what manner\'a0of spirit ye are of\u894  for\'a0 the Son of Man is not come to destroy\'a0men\'92s lives, but to save them.\'94\'a0 Suppose he had said: \'93We will thrash them\'a0until they\'a0understand who we are,\'94\'a0how different would have been the history of Christianity! Compare, if you will, the swaggering, bullying, brutal doctrine of imperialism with the golden rule and the commandment, \'93Thou shalt love thy\'a0neighbor\'a0as thyself.\'94\'a0 Love not force, was the weapon of the Nazarene\u894  sacrifice for\'a0others, not the exploitation of them, was His\'a0 method of reaching the human heart. A\'a0missionary\'a0recently\'a0told me that the Stars and Stripes once saved his life because his assailant recognized our\'a0flag as a flag that had no blood upon it.  Let it be known that our\'a0missionaries are seeking souls\'a0instead of sovereignty\u894  let be it known that instead of being the advance guard of conquering armies, they\'a0are going forth to help and uplift, having their\'a0loins girt about with the truth and their\'a0feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace, wearing the breastplate of righteousness and carrying the sword of the spirit\u894  let it be known that they are citizens of a nation which respects the rights of the citizens of other\'a0nations as carefully\'a0as it protects the rights of its own citizens, and the welcome given to our\'a0missionaries will be more cordial than the welcome extended to the missionaries\'a0 of any\'a0other\'a0nation. The argument made by some that it was unfortunate for\'a0the nation that it had anything to do with the Philippine Islands, but that the naval victory\'a0at Manila made the permanent acquisition of those islands\'a0 necessary, is also unsound. We won a naval victory\'a0at Santiago, but that did not compel us to hold Cuba. The shedding of American blood in the Philippine Islands does not make it imperative that we should retain possession forever\u894  American blood was shed at San Juan and El Caney, and yet the President has\'a0 promised the Cubans independence. The fact that the American flag floats over\'a0Manila does not compel us\'a0 to exercise perpetual sovereignty\'a0over\'a0the islands\u894  the American flag floats over\'a0Havana to\'adday, but the President has promised to haul it down when the flag of the Cuban Republic\'a0is ready\'a0to rise in its place. Better\'a0a thousand times that our flag in the Orient give way\'a0to a flag representing the idea of self\'ad\'a0 government than that the flag of this Republic\'a0should become the flag of an empire. There is an easy, honest, honorable solution of the Philippine question. It is set forth in the Democratic\'a0 platform\'a0and it is submitted with confidence to the American people. This plan I unreservedly\'a0indorse. If elected, I will convene Congress in extraordinary\'a0session as soon as inaugurated and recommend an immediate declaration of the nation\'92s purpose, first, to establish a stable form\'a0of government in the Philippine Islands, just as we are now establishing a stable form\'a0of government in Cuba\u894  second, to give independence to the Filipinos as we have promised to give independence to the Cubans\u894  third, to protect the Filipinos from outside interference while they\'a0work\'a0out their destiny, just as we have protected the republics of Central and South America, and are, by\'a0the Monroe doctrine, pledged to protect Cuba. A\'a0European protectorate often results in the plundering of the ward by\'a0the guardian. An American protectorate gives to the nation protected the advantage of our\'a0strength, without making it he victim\'a0of our\'a0 greed. For three\'adquarters of a century\'a0the Monroe doctrine has been a shield to neighboring republics and yet it has imposed no pecuniary\'a0burden upon us. After\'a0the Filipinos had aided us in the war\'a0against Spain, we could not leave them to be the victims of the ambitious designs of European nations, and since we do not desire to make them\'a0a part of us or\'a0to hold them as subjects, we propose the only\'a0alternative, namely, to give them\'a0independence and guard them against molestation from\'a0without. When our\'a0opponents are unable to defend their\'a0position by\'a0argument they\'a0fall back\'a0upon the assertion that is destiny, and insist that we must submit to it, no matter\'a0how much it violates our\'a0moral percepts and our\'a0 principles of government. This is a complacent philosophy. It obliterates the distinction between right and wrong and makes individuals and nations the helpless victims of circumstance. Destiny\'a0is the subterfuge of the invertebrate, who, lacking the courage to oppose error, seeks some plausible excuse for\'a0supporting it. Washington said that the destiny of the republican form of government was deeply, if not finally, staked on the experiment entrusted to the American people. How different Washington\'92s definition of destiny\'a0from the Republican definition! The Republicans say\'a0that this nation is in the hands of destiny\u894  Washington believed that not only\'a0the destiny\'a0of our\'a0own nation but the destiny of the republican form of government throughout the world was\'a0 intrusted to American hands. Immeasurable responsibility! The destiny\'a0of this Republic\'a0is in the hands of its own people, and upon the success of the experiment here rests the hope of humanity. No exterior\'a0force can disturb this Republic, and no foreign influence should be permitted to change its course. What the future has in store for this nation no one has authority\'a0to declare, but each individual has his\'a0own idea of the nation\'92s mission, and he owes it to his country as well as to himself to contribute as best he may to the fulfillment of that mission. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Committee: I can never\'a0fully discharge the debt of gratitude which I owe to my countrymen for\'a0the honors which they\'a0have so generously\'a0bestowed upon me\u894  but, sirs, whether\'a0 it be my lot to occupy\'a0the high office for\'a0which the convention has named me, or to spend the remainder\'a0of my days in private life, it shall be my constant ambition and my controlling purpose to aid in realizing the high ideals of those whose wisdom and courage and sacrifices brought the Republic into existence. I can conceive of a national destiny\'a0surpassing the glories of the present and the past \'ad\'ad\'a0a destiny which meets the responsibility\'a0of today\'a0and measures up to the possibilities of the future. Behold a republic, resting securely\'a0upon the foundation stones quarried by\'a0revolutionary patriots from the mountain of eternal truth \'ad\'ad\'a0a republic applying in practice and proclaiming to the world the self\'adevident propositions that all men are created equal\u894  that they\'a0are endowed with inalienable rights\u894  that governments are instituted among men to secure these rights, and that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. Behold a republic\'a0in which civil and religion liberty stimulate all to earnest endeavor and in which the law restrains every\'a0hand uplifted for a neighbor's injury\'a0\'ad\'ad\'a0a republic in which every\'a0citizen is a sovereign, but in which no one cares to wear\'a0a crown. Behold a republic standing erect while empires all around are bowed beneath the weight of their\'a0own armaments\'a0\'ad\'ad\'a0a republic\'a0whose flag is loved while other\'a0flags are only\'a0 feared. Behold a republic\'a0increasing in population, in wealth, in strength and in influence, solving the problems of civilization and hastening the coming of an universal brotherhood \'ad\'ad\'a0a republic\'a0which shakes\'a0 thrones and dissolves aristocracies by\'a0its silent example and gives light and inspiration to those who sit in darkness. Behold a republic\'a0gradually but surely\'a0becoming the supreme moral factor\'a0in the world's progress\'a0 and the accepted arbiter\'a0of the world's disputes\'a0\'ad\'ad\'a0a republic whose history, like the path of the just, "is as\'a0 the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.}
