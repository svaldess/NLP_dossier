# Natural Language Processing Dossier

This repo is dedicated to some of my NLP projects, which include:

### Entity finder in news
This notebook extracts entities from Reuters news articles and computes the most mentioned entities. Python, **SpaCy** and **NLTK** were used.

### Entity annotation
Entity annotation is one of the most common tasks in NLP. This notebook compares manual annotation vs automatic tagging with **SpaCy**. Cohen's Kappa coefficient is computed to calculate agreement between two annotaros (a.k.a. persons manually tagging the entities). 

### Analyzing the readibility of famous speeches
This notebook calculates the **Flesch score**, grade and ease of famous US speeches and of all Presidential Inaugural speeches (from Washington to Trump!). The purpose is to understand if language (when addressing a broad audience) has become "easier". Python and **NLTK** were used. 

### Extracting jargon
This notebook extracts the jargon from job descriptions with **NLTK**. Ngrams are also computed.

### Automatic Terminology Extraction of data science job descriptions
Project elaborated with _Anwesha Tomar_ and _Marta Matosas Fonolleda_. This project addresses the question if data science terminology found in job descriptions changes across different US cities and different industries.
